# alien_invasion

This project is an Alien Invasion game clone created while following the "Python Crash Course" book. Utilizing the  Pygame library as the game engine, this project allowed for a hands-on application of the concepts outlined in the book.

## Overview
The game is a recreation of the classic Alien Invasion arcade-style game, where the player controls a spaceship tasked with defending the Earth from an alien invasion. The objective is to shoot down waves of incoming alien ships while avoiding colliding with them and navigating through various levels of increasing difficulty.

## Learning Experience
Through developing this project, several key learnings were acquired:

### Object-Oriented Programming Principles
The project heavily emphasized the utilization of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism were applied to create organized and scalable code structures. This allowed for the efficient management of game entities, behaviors, and interactions.

### Python Proficiency
The project significantly contributed to strengthening Python programming skills. Working with Pygame not only facilitated game development but also enhanced familiarity with Python syntax, data structures, and functionalities. This hands-on experience proved instrumental in deepening understanding and fluency in the language.

## How to Run
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the Pygame library. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the main Python file to launch the game:
```python
python alien_invasion.py
```
